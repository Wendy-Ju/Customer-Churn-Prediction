# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project starts with a user-related dataset and covers the entire process of customer churn prediction analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering and encoding, model development, and parameter tuning optimization. It also allows us to intervene with targeted retention strategies, ultimately enhancing customer loyalty and reducing churn.
